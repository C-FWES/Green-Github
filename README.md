## Summary
The current repository contains incomplete code for sorting algorithms. You task is to clone/fork and edit the code to make functional algorithms. The code also implements timeit functions to test the efficiency of an algorithm. To propose your changes don't forget to pull request


## Objectives

-  Program the existing sorting functions (you can search up how they work if you don't know, don't use someone else's code though!!!)
-  Perhaps add some of your own algoritms, or some that you could find on the internet
-  Enchance the input experience, (Perhaps show the existing list, or delete items)
-  Add a GUI (Use tkinter, or any other imported library and mention which one you used when you make the pull request)
-  ... or any other improvements you may see fit!
